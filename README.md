# APY313 Data Practical Final: Exploring Menstrual Cycle and Movement Patterns

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project investigates the relationship between menstrual cycle phases and movement behaviors through a deeply personal and exploratory lens. Using self-tracked Strava activity data and manually recorded menstrual cycle dates, the study maps physical activity across hormonal phases to uncover potential behavioral patterns linked to internal physiological states.

The work stems from a broader vision: to bridge the gap in women's health understanding through personalized, data-driven tools. It challenges conventional, one-size-fits-all health metrics by framing the menstrual cycle as a *powerful tool for self-awareness, alignment, and optimization*.

## 💡 Motivation

Women's health remains significantly under-researched — often treated as a black box, with hormonal fluctuations rarely accounted for in health tech. This project asks:  
**How might we design tools that truly understand and support the nuanced rhythms of the female body and mind?**

The analysis presented here lays the foundation for a broader initiative: a holistic AI-powered health toolkit designed to help women align their lifestyle with their biology.

## 📊 What This Repo Includes

## 🔍 Key Features of the Analysis

- Pulls movement data from the Strava API and processes it using R
- Categorizes workouts into cycle phases: **Menstrual**, **Follicular**, **Ovulatory**, **Luteal**
- Analyzes patterns in distance, frequency, speed, and activity type
- Performs ANOVA to explore statistical significance
- Visualizes trends with charts and summary tables

## 🧬 Themes Explored

- The mind-body connection  
- Self-tracking as a tool for empowerment  
- The menstrual cycle as a lens for behavior and performance  
- The need for personalized, gender-specific health technologies

## 🚀 Future Vision

This project is a stepping stone toward building a **women’s health AI toolkit** — a personalized, intelligent companion that:

- Learns from a user’s lived data  
- Offers meaningful insights rooted in hormonal context  
- Guides lifestyle choices based on cycle-aware recommendations
